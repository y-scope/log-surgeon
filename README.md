# log-surgeon: A performant log parsing library

[![CLP on Zulip](https://img.shields.io/badge/zulip-yscope--clp%20chat-1888FA?logo=zulip)](https://yscope-clp.zulipchat.com/)

`log-surgeon` is a library for high-performance parsing of unstructured text
logs. It allows users to parse and extract information from the vast amount of
unstructured logs generated by today's open-source software.

Some of the library's features include:

* Parsing and extracting variable values like the log event's log-level and any
  other user-specified variables, no matter where they appear in each log event.
* Parsing by using regular expressions for each variable type rather than
  regular expressions for an entire log event.
* Improved latency, and memory efficiency compared to popular regex engines.
* Parsing multi-line log events (delimited by timestamps).

Note that `log-surgeon` is *not* a generic regex engine and does impose [some
constraints](docs/parsing-constraints.md) on how log events can be parsed.

## Motivating example

Let's say we want to parse and inspect multi-line log events like this:

```
2023-02-23T18:10:14-0500 DEBUG task_123 crashed. Dumping stacktrace:
#0  0x000000000040110e in bar () at example.cpp:6
#1  0x000000000040111d in bar () at example.cpp:10
#2  0x0000000000401129 in main () at example.cpp:15
```

Using the [example schema file](examples/schema.txt) which includes these rules:

```
timestamp:\d{4}\-\d{2}\-\d{2}T\d{2}:\d{2}:\d{2}\-\d{4}
...
loglevel:INFO|DEBUG|WARN|ERROR
```

We can parse and inspect the events as follows:

```cpp
// Define a reader to read from your data source
Reader reader{/* <Omitted> */};

// Instantiate the parser
ReaderParser parser{"examples/schema.txt"};
parser.reset_and_set_reader(reader);

// Get the loglevel variable's ID
optional<uint32_t> loglevel_id{parser.get_variable_id("loglevel")};
// <Omitted validation of loglevel_id>

while (false == parser.done()) {
    if (ErrorCode err{parser.parse_next_event()}; ErrorCode::Success != err) {
        throw runtime_error("Parsing Failed");
    }

    // Get and print the timestamp
    Token* timestamp{event.get_timestamp()};
    if (nullptr != timestamp) {
        cout << "timestamp: " << timestamp->to_string_view() << endl;
    }

    // Get and print the log-level
    auto const& loglevels = event.get_variables(*loglevel_id);
    if (false == loglevels.empty()) {
        // In case there are multiple matches, just get the first one
        cout << "loglevel:" << loglevels[0]->to_string_view() << endl;
    }

    // Other analysis...

    // Print the entire event
    LogEventView const& event = parser.get_log_parser().get_log_event_view();
    cout << event->to_string() << endl;
}
```

For advanced uses, `log-surgeon` also has a
[BufferParser](examples/buffer-parser.cpp) that reads directly from a buffer.

## Building and installing

Requirements:

* CMake >= 3.22.1
* GCC >= 10 or Clang >= 7
* [Catch2] >= 3.8.1
* [fmt] >= 8.0.1
* [GSL] >= 4.0.0
* [Task] >= 3.38
* [uv] >= 0.7.10

To build and install the project to `$HOME/.local`:

```shell
task log-surgeon:install-release INSTALL_PREFIX="$HOME/.local"
```

Or to only build the project:

```shell
task log-surgeon:build-release
```

To build the debug version:

```shell
task log-surgeon:build-debug
```

## Examples

[examples](examples) contains programs demonstrating usage of the library. See
[examples/README.md](examples/README.md) for information on building and running the examples.

## Documentation

* [docs](docs) contains more detailed documentation including:
  * The [schema specification](docs/schema.md), which describes the syntax for
    writing your own schema
  * `log-surgeon`'s [design objectives](docs/design-objectives.md)

### Documentation site

The project includes a documentation site that's useful for exploring functionality and test
coverage. In particular, it documents all unit tests, with additional detail for API-level tests.

To generate and view the files:

* Run `task docs:site`.
* Open `build/docs/html/index.html` in your preferred browser.

To host the site locally and view it:

* Run `task docs:serve`.
* Open the URL output by the task in your preferred browser.

## Testing

To build and run all unit tests:

```shell
task test:run-debug
```

When generating targets, the CMake variable `BUILD_TESTING` is followed (unless overruled by setting
`log_surgeon_BUILD_TESTING` to false). By default, if built as a top-level project, `BUILD_TESTING`
is set to true and unit tests are built.

## Linting

Before submitting a PR, ensure you've run our linting tools and either fixed any violations or
suppressed the warning.

### Running the linters

To report all errors, run:

```shell
task lint:check
```

To automatically fix any supported format or linting errors, run:

```shell
task lint:fix
```

## Known issues

The following are issues we're aware of and working on:
* Schema rules must use ASCII characters. We will release UTF-8 support in a
  future release.
* Timestamps must appear at the start of the message to be handled specially
  (than other variable values) and support multi-line log events.
* A variable pattern has no way to match text around a variable, without having
  it also be a part of the variable.
  * Support for submatch extraction will be coming in a future release.
